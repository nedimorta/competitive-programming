# [Self Balancing Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/self-balancing-tree/problem)

An AVL tree (Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis' tree, named after the inventors) is a self-balancing binary search tree. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

We define balance factor for each node as :

```
balanceFactor = height(leftSubtree) - height(rightSubtree)
```

The balance factor of any node of an AVL tree is in the integer range [-1,+1]. If after any modification in the tree, the balance factor becomes less than âˆ’1 or greater than +1, the subtree rooted at this node is unbalanced, and a rotation is needed.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)

You are given a pointer to the root of an AVL tree. You need to insert a value into this tree and perform the necessary rotations to ensure that it remains balanced.


## Input Format

You are given a function,

```
Node * insert(Node * root, int new_val)
{

}
```

'node' is defined as :

```
struct node
{
    int val;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
    int ht;
};
```

You only have to complete the function.

Note: All the values in the tree will be distinct. Height of a Null node is -1 and the height of the leaf node is 0.

## Output Format

Insert the new value into the tree and return a pointer to the root of the tree. Ensure that the tree remains balanced.

## Sample Input

```
   3
  / \
 2   4
      \
       5
```

The value to be inserted is 6.

## Sample Output

```
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5 
        / \
       4   6
```

## Explanation

After inserting 6 in the tree. the tree becomes:

```
    3 (Balance Factor = -2)
   / \
  2   4 (Balance Factor = -2)
       \
        5 (Balance Factor = -1)
         \
          6 (Balance Factor = 0)
```

Balance Factor of nodes 3 and 4 is no longer in the range [-1,1]. We need to perform a rotation to balance the tree. This is the right right case. We perform a single rotation to balance the tree.

After performing the rotation, the tree becomes :

```
                              3 (Balance Factor = -1)
                             / \
      (Balance Factor = 0)  2   5 (Balance Factor = 0)
                               / \
        (Balance Factor = 0)  4   6 (Balance Factor = 0)
```
