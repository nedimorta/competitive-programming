# [Height of a Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/tree-height-of-a-binary-tree/problem)

The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. For example, the following binary tree is of height **2**:

## Function Description

Complete the getHeight or height function in the editor. It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.

getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):

- **root**: a reference to the root of a binary tree.

**Note**: The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer **n**, the number of nodes in the tree.

Next line contains **n** space separated integer where **i<sup>th</sup>** integer denotes node[i].data.

**Note**: Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function. In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ **node.data[i]** ≤ 20
- 1 ≤ **n** ≤ 20

## Output Format

Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

## Sample Input

## Sample Output

`3`

## Explanation

The longest root-to-leaf path is shown below:

There are ***4*** nodes in this path that are connected by ***3*** edges, meaning our binary tree's ***height = 3*** .
